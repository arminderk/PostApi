# PostsApi
Simple PHP API to Retrieve Posts
This is a simple experimental api I developed to get a better understanding in developing api's using PHP.
Note: The api has a dbseed.php file that can be ran to create the table and add temporary records for testing.

## Running the api locally
You can run the api using MAMP or any other local server
``` bash
# run a local php server
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
```

# Technologies Used:
* PHP
* PHP PDO
* MySQL
